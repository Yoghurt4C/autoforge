just a simple automation tool for the abhorrent and intellectually offensive Guild Wars 2 UI

autoforge.ahk is the proverbial version and requires [AutoHotkey v2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe); don't expect any updates for this one

autoforge.py requires [Python >=3.4](https://www.python.org/) and [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/)

coming in the distant future:
* ~~automatic venv creation~~
* non-1080p resolution support
* simple gui/systray icon for the gormless (me)
* more functions to cover shit that annoys me
